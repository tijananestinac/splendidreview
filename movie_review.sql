(1, 'The story of Little Women is coloured by the complementarity of the four March sisters, each with different desires and ambitions, who end up with completely different futures. Beth, the quiet and musical one, contracts scarlet fever and passes away. Amy, the artistic one who yearns to be loved, aspires to marry rich from the off, and ends up with Laurie, the March family‚Äôs handsome and wealthy neighbour. Meg, the eldest and most selfless one, marries Laurie‚Äôs tutor John Brooks and has children at the film and book‚Äôs halfway point. And Jo? Arguably the main character, the headstrong writer who has always sworn herself to remain independent? Now, here‚Äôs where the story begins to bend.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWhen I saw this ending for the first time on the big screen, I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. The tropes I‚Äôve grown so tired of, the happy endings that feel untrue and incomplete, were coloured here in a different light ‚Äì not mocked, but entirely transformed. The subversion took me by surprise precisely because of how fluid it is. It\'s an ending that leaves me free to place faith in whichever outcome I need, whenever I need it.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nI love the grace and the hope I feel when watching it unfold. I admire the way Gerwig toes the line between audacity and care, at all times. This ending gives each and every viewer the confidence to know that there can always be another way to keep faith, and see a new future in the same story.\r\n\r\n	\r\n'),
(2, 'Jibran (Nanjiana) and Leilani (Issae Rae) are a couple on the brink. Once soul mates, their four-year-long relationship has become a breeding ground for spiteful digs and petty arguments. En route to a friend‚Äôs party, they finally decide to break up ‚Äì only for their car to collide with a bicyclist. Before long, their vehicle has been hi-jacked by a violent hitman, who murders the bicyclist and frames them as the killers. The only way out, apparently, is to solve the murder before the cops do, thus proving their innocence. Inevitably, this leads them into a far larger conspiracy, but none of it feels plausible, even in a wacky comedy like this.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis is a very shouty film, where basically every line is yelled and every conversation is delivered in squawky, back-and-forth exchanges, punctuated with hit-and-miss pop cultural references. There is a breeziness to the whole affair as it goes from one scene to the next, yet it feels so lightweight, disposable and contrived ‚Äì you basically stop thinking about The Lovebirds before it‚Äôs even over. Characters come and go with little consequence, whilst people are shot and maimed in a way that undermines the light-hearted tone. At the halfway point it starts to feel like a slog; we know what‚Äôs going to happen.\r\n'),
(3, 'The great joy of any Bong movie, of course, is that you rarely know where it‚Äôs headed. Parasite takes this conceit to the next level, resulting in his most unique and uncompromising work to date ‚Äì confirmation of the director as a genre in and of himself, nailing an idiosyncratic style he has slowly and meticulously built from the ground up.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nParasite is as elegantly composed and engaging as any film you are likely to encounter this ‚Äì or any ‚Äì year, and its immensely talented cast deserve the highest praise for allowing us to feel equal sympathy and distain for their characters, for selling us moments of comedy and melancholy, often in the same breath. My lone reservation lies in the film‚Äôs final quarter, which I don‚Äôt think is handled with quite the same brilliantly thought-out, precision engineering as the rest. It‚Äôs a minor complaint in a major work, though, and one that confirms Bong as one of cinema‚Äôs great modern visionaries. Single-handedly he makes the idea of genre seem so reductive. Why have one when you can have them all?\r\n\r\n'),
(4, 'A modern mansion sitting on the edge of a cliff; waves crashing against it in a tumultuous storm; a woman quietly escaping at night while her lover is asleep, as sinister violins play on the soundtrack: all the money in the world couldn‚Äôt keep her with him. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf the metaphor isn‚Äôt particularly subtle, it is still extremely effective at representing the sense of endless dread that gaslighting and trauma (itself another way by which someone, too caught up in the webs of hurtful memory, is denied her experience of the world as it really is in the present) create in their victims. With his own invisible man film, Hollow Man, Paul Verhoeven made explicit the bad behaviour that one would inevitably engage in if he couldn‚Äôt be held accountable for it. The Invisible Man manages to be an even more unpleasant watch ‚Äì as well as a more interesting one ‚Äì because it focuses the other side of that dynamic, and understands that having one‚Äôs sense of reality refuted by men who try to make their actions disappear is already a common experience.'),
(5, 'First and foremost is Mulligan who is sensationally good as Cassie, showing hitherto unseen comic abilities, the kind of performance that never relents, it just builds and builds until finally it explodes. She‚Äôs always been good but never this flooring and with her headlining almost every scene, the film is forever compelling as a result as it‚Äôs impossible to drag your eyes away from her, curious to know just what she‚Äôll do next. There‚Äôs also a magnetic turn from Bo Burnham as her love interest and the pair have genuine chemistry, enough to fill an entirely separate romantic comedy.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe plot takes some darker turns as we learn Cassie‚Äôs backstory and while Mulligan is able to sell the more dramatic elements given her background, the severe tonal shifts don‚Äôt always work quite as well as she does. Fennell can‚Äôt seem to decide what kind of film she wants to make and it‚Äôs only because so much of it soars, that I found myself frustrated by the elements and decisions that threaten to crash the whole thing down. It remains afloat though, scrappily, as Fennell‚Äôs ruthless puncturing of straight-bro toxicity is sharp until the sure-to-be-divisive finale which is bravely and perhaps realistically dour with its worldview.'),
(6, 'In chess, an ‚Äúendgame‚Äù sees relatively few pieces on the board ‚Äì but of course, this film is much more heavily populated. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is floating, desolately, in space, staring extinction in the face. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) confronts the loss of his family ‚Äì a rather eerie, challengingly downbeat opening scene. Steve Rogers, formerly Captain America (Chris Evans) is helping others deal with their awful sense of cosmic grief. Rhodey (Don Cheadle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are grimly getting on things. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) is a vivid new presence in everyone‚Äôs lives.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAvengers: Endgame is entirely preposterous and, yes, the central plot device here does not, in itself, deliver the shock of the new. But the sheer enjoyment and fun that it delivers, the pure exotic spectacle, are irresistible, as is its insouciant way of combining the serious and the comic. Without the comedy, the drama would not be palatable. Yet without the earnest, almost childlike belief in the seriousness of what is at stake, the funny stuff would not work either. As an artificial creation, the Avengers have been triumphant, and as entertainment, they have been unconquerable.'),
(7, 'It can be easy to overstate the case of a movie like ‚ÄúReady or Not.‚Äù It‚Äôs replete with ‚Äòbadass‚Äô images of Grace in her wedding dress wearing post-\"Kill Bill\" swagger heading to do battle with the batty Le Domas progeny, covered in blood, sporting a bandolier, a half-baked quip, and a ripped wedding dress. It‚Äôs filled with easy jokes about the insanity of the rich and the callousness with which they take to their task of hunting and killing a woman on the grounds of their mansion. It‚Äôs got cavalier work from Brody, MacDowell (who struggles a little with the tone), and Kristian Bruun as Emeilie‚Äôs jackass husband, but they should all be funnier and they should all have been given a little more to chew. Czerny and Weaving are the only ones who fully seize every second of their screen time, showcasing the full bodied comedy and crazy eyed horror this might have been. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe film is charismatic and thrilling enough to bypass its shortcomings. Weaving makes for a very likable hero, with a broad comedic appeal, an every-girl clumsiness and sarcastic rejoinder for everything. In a better world, she‚Äôd be headlining comedies already. She makes for a likable action hero precisely because she knows and shows that the clothes don‚Äôt fit her. In her tattered wedding dress, she fights for her life against everyone from her young nephews to the butler. Every wound she receive shows her that the backwards morality by which the rich live is so deeply ingrained that no amount of pleading could right the course. It‚Äôs also her first clue that not even her beloved Alex will be able to get her out of this jam. She‚Äôs not just fighting people, she‚Äôs fighting tradition and the idea of family. '),
(8, 'With ‚ÄúSwallow,‚Äù director Carlo Mirabella-Davis draws us into the domestic horror of a housewife. Against a backdrop of pink hues, Hunter (Haley Bennett), a soft-spoken new bride, finds her inner life spiraling. Born into a troubled home, Hunter has married into a picture-perfect wealthy family. Her acceptance, however, quickly becomes conditional on her obedience, as she spends long days in her husband\'s isolated modernist home, overlooking an endless forest. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nUnlike many pregnancy-themed horror movies, ‚ÄúSwallow,‚Äù quite radically, doesn\'t linger on the monstrosity of the body and transformations that come with it. It is a film that inverses the typical trajectory by having a character begin in a state of subjugation, who slowly fights for ownership and freedom over her body and life. ‚ÄúSwallow‚Äù is an uncompromising horror that evokes deeply rooted alienation and dysmorphia. Hunter‚Äôs journey will take her on a path towards connecting the mind and body, even only briefly. Only Jonathan Glazer\'s ‚ÄúUnder the Skin‚Äù does a better job of evoking the particular pull of being an outsider in your own body. '),
(9, 'With its sheer warmth, openness, likability and idealism, Love, Simon won me over. It takes all the corniness and tweeness of the coming-of-age genre and transplants new heart into it. A high-school kid is about to come out as gay. This is Simon, played by 23-year-old Nick Robinson, and his story puts a smart new spin on straight romcom classics such as The Shop Around the Corner and You‚Äôve Got Mail, with their anonymised romances.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis movie‚Äôs storyline does come carefully encased in an unassumingly small-c conservative plot superstructure, and in the real world not everyone in Simon‚Äôs situation has such a well-off home, sophisticated and pricey vinyl collection or impeccably liberal, non-bigoted family and circle of friends, whose reactions are never in doubt. Here the hostility is carefully quarantined to a couple of obviously homophobic boys, whose narrative function is to be trounced and then tacitly forgiven. The only other out gay kid in the school is almost impossibly witty and well-adjusted, nearly middle-aged in his droll composure. In real life, things are a bit more muddled than that. But what a smart, fun, engaging film.'),
(10, 'A thrillingly versatile film-maker C√©line Sciamma has proved to be. Having made an arthouse splash with the Euro-hits Water Lilies and Tomboy, she wrote and directed Girlhood (Bande de filles), a breathtaking portrait of modern ‚Äúbanlieue life‚Äù that completed her ‚Äúaccidental trilogy of youth‚Äù. Her impressive screenplay credits include Claude Barras‚Äôs My Life as a Courgette, a tenderly empathetic, French-Swiss stop-motion masterpiece that earned an Oscar nomination for its vividly resilient depiction of children in care. In each of these very different projects, Sciamma has struck an accessible chord by focusing tightly on specifics, finding the key to universal appeal in the unique, tiny details of each story and character.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDigitally filmed in tactile, painterly hues by Claire Mathon, who did such shimmering work on Mati Diop‚Äôs Atlantics, Portrait of a Lady on Fire (the French title uses the less Jamesian ‚Äújeune fille‚Äù) seamlessly intertwines themes of love and politics, representation and reality. At times it plays like a breathless romance, trembling with passionate anticipation. Elsewhere, it seems closer to a sociopolitical treatise, what Sciamma has called ‚Äúa manifesto about the female gaze‚Äù.'),
(11, 'Even if it had nothing else going for it, Black Panther would still be the best-looking Marvel movie yet. Supersaturated with vivid afro-futurism and as bold and riotous as a rack of dashiki print shirts, it looks like a particularly excitable Sun Ra album cover. Fortunately, the film doesn‚Äôt trade on looks alone.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nT‚ÄôChalla inherits the throne of Wakanda, the secretive techtropolis that has concealed itself from the rest of the world. And he assumes the mantle of Black Panther, complete with an impenetrable battle suit engineered by his genius kid sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright, who gets to play with most of the best lines as well as all the cool kit). Supporting T‚ÄôChalla is Wakanda‚Äôs top warrior, Okoye (Danai Gurira), lethal with a spear but who also, in one gif-friendly shot, does an impressive amount of damage by hurling her wig.'),
(12, 'He might be able to summon lightning from the skies and smite foes with his mighty hammer, but this latest comic-book outing bestows upon Thor an even super-er superpower: a sense of humour. It‚Äôs there from the opening seconds, when we find our Norse god dangling before some horned demon, whose portentous monologuing is undercut by Thor‚Äôs continual interruptions, as he slowly spins around on his chains: ‚ÄúHang on a minute‚Ä¶ coming round again.‚Äù For a relative newcomer to the Earth, Thor has clearly got the knack of 21st-century comic timing.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFans will be satisfied at the most fleshed-out performance of Hulk we‚Äôve yet had in this Marvel universe, though Mark Ruffalo is charmingly confused when he‚Äôs being Bruce Banner. And rounding out the cast is Tessa Thompson, who turns up as a lapsed warrior from Thor‚Äôs neck of the cosmos, which is a useful coincidence. There are a great many corners cut, plot holes papered over, and laws of physics bent out of recognition in this movie, to be honest. And if you‚Äôve sat through the past dozen recent Marvel movies, you‚Äôll find the core elements very familiar ‚Äì a rag-tag team of heroes (Thor unimaginatively dubs them ‚Äúthe Revengers‚Äù), an all-powerful antagonist, an impending apocalypse, and a set of essentially unkillable characters. Added to which, the liberal use of CGI and green screen makes for a visual flimsiness. Even the scenes set in ‚ÄúNorway‚Äù look fake.'),
(13, 'With its makeshift family, high-speed car chases, and elaborate heists, Netflix‚Äôs action blockbuster ‚Äú6 Underground‚Äù is solid proof that Michael Bay would love to direct a ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù or ‚ÄúFast and Furious‚Äù movie. It also makes it clear why that would be a bad idea.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBefore we get up in arms about what\'s \"allowed\" to be in an action movie, whether or not the subject matter rubs you the wrong way doesn\'t really matter because the main purpose of a film like ‚Äú6 Underground‚Äù is to entertain. No one is really arguing otherwise. (I just don\'t find reflections of the last decade in Syria entertaining.) Most important, the film simply comes apart under that basic definition of its purpose. It becomes repetitive, nonsensical, and just loud after everyone gets an origin story and we\'re left with nothing to do but go boom. At the end, one of the characters even seems to understand that this is how most viewers will feel after watching, saying that this team can still ‚Äúdo some shit ‚Ä¶ awfully loud.‚Äù ‚Äú6 Underground‚Äù is definitely some awfully loud shit. \r\n'),
(14, 'This rip-roaring, record-breaking South Korean zombies-on-a-train romp barrels along like a runaway locomotive ‚Äì The Railing Dead. Owing as much to Bong Joon-ho (director of creature-feature hit The Host) as to George A Romero, Yeon Sang-ho‚Äôs breathless cinematic bullet train boasts frantic physical action, sharp social satire and ripe sentimental melodrama designed to reach into your ribcage and rip out your bleeding heart. Faster on its feet than 2004‚Äôs Dawn of the Dead remake, wittier than Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and more thrillingly spectacular than World War Z, Train to Busan joins The Girl With All the Gifts in breathing new life into a genre that simply refuses to lie down and die.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAs with Yeon‚Äôs previous work, a healthy distrust of authority underpins the action, a theme amplified here in the wake of the 2015 Mers outbreak. ‚ÄúFellow citizens, please refrain from responding to baseless rumours,‚Äù burbles an authoritarian voice on TV, even as social media is awash with apocalyptic images of bodies falling from the skies and bloodshed on the streets. ‚ÄúWe must stay calm and trust the government. We believe that your safety is not in jeopardy!‚Äù Crucially, the virulence of this outbreak is clearly equated with poisonous traits already embedded in society, with Seok-woo being pointedly described as ‚Äúa bloodsucker‚Äù who ‚Äúleeches off others‚Äù even as zombies sink their teeth into passengers.'),
(15, 'Kudos to whoever it was at DC Comics who realised that, while the good guys in the stable are kind of played out (and let‚Äôs face it, the Batsuit is looking increasingly like a concrete boot for the career), there is all kinds of fun to be had with the bad guys. Further props to DC for riding out the initial wobble that was Suicide Squad and ploughing forward with first Joker and now Birds of Prey, a showcase for the exuberantly unhinged Harley Quinn, who, when the film starts, is in the process of carving out her place in the world following her breakup with the J-man.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDirector Cathy Yan brilliantly captures a gaudy, grubby sense of place, part Gotham City, part the sparking trash-fire inside Harley‚Äôs head. And, while there‚Äôs an unfortunate It‚Äôs a Knockout vibe to some of the action, for the most part it‚Äôs a riot: slickly choreographed bone-snapping chaos executed with a demented, cheerleading flourish.'),
(16, 'The lip-smacking, acid drops of malice in the latest film from Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) makes this unexpectedly cruel comedy as intoxicating as the mid-afternoon martinis swilled by the two central characters. Anna Kendrick is Stephanie, the annoyingly chipper mum who always goes that extra mile when it comes to extracurricular point-scoring. Blake Lively is Emily, the hard-as-a-gel-manicure fashion PR exec whose idea of a playdate begins and ends with cocktails. But somehow, over shared confidences and gin, the pair become best friends. Then Emily asks Stephanie one simple favour ‚Äì to collect her son from school ‚Äì and disappears.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nKendrick is a perky delight as a character who is by no means as squeaky-clean as she first appears. Her investigation into the truth behind Emily‚Äôs fate features inventive but not always convincing disguises (‚ÄúNever wear a vintage Herm√®s scarf with a Gap T-shirt. If you were truly Emily‚Äôs friend, you would know that,‚Äù snarks Emily‚Äôs boss) and gloriously passive-aggressive use of her Mommy-vlog. The film earns extra points for a flirty wink of a soundtrack full of breathy 1960s French pop.'),
(17, 'With meticulous attention to detail (plaudits to production designer Dennis Gassner) and astonishingly fluid cinematography by Roger Deakins that shifts from ground level to God‚Äôs-eye view, Mendes puts his audience right there in the middle of the unfolding chaos. There‚Äôs a real sense of epic scale as the action moves breathlessly from one hellish environment to the next, effectively capturing our reluctant heroes‚Äô sense of anxiety and discovery as they stumble into each new unchartered terrain. This is nail-biting stuff, interspersed with genuine shocks and surprises. Whether it‚Äôs a tripwire moment that provokes an audible gasp, a distant dogfight segueing into up-close-and-personal horror, or a single gunshot that made me jump out of my seat during an otherwise near-silent sequence, there‚Äôs no doubting the film‚Äôs theatrical impact.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThroughout this Homeric odyssey, Thomas Newman‚Äôs pulsing score ratchets up the tension, travelling ‚Äúup the down trench‚Äù, through the body-strewn carnage of no man‚Äôs land (a forest of wood and wire, bone and blood) and into the eerie environs of deserted farmhouses and bombed-out churches. Occasionally, we hear echoes of the rising crescendo of Hans Zimmer‚Äôs Dunkirk score; elsewhere, Newman‚Äôs cues are full of piercing melancholia mingled with distant threat.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn a film in which music plays such a crucial role, it‚Äôs significant that perhaps the most powerful scene is an interlude of song. Emerging from a river after a baptismal episode of death and rebirth, we find ourselves in a wood where a young man sings The Wayfaring Stranger. It‚Äôs an interlude that brings the characters and audiences together in silence, communally experiencing that still-small voice of calm that lies at the heart of so many great war movies.'),
(18, 'If ever a film had me mentally tiptoeing over a booby-trapped carpet of eggshells while silently gibbering with anxiety, it‚Äôs this brutal sci-fi suspense thriller, written by horror specialists Scott Beck and Bryan Woods and directed by John Krasinski, who developed the screenplay with them and stars ‚Äì alongside Emily Blunt. It‚Äôs set in a postapocalyptic wasteland. But this isn‚Äôt a young adult drama, it‚Äôs a prematurely old adult drama, a world in which innocence, childhood and happiness have been blowtorched off the face of the Earth.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA Quiet Place allows you to worry at a strange thought: might it be possible to live life entirely safely and even normally in this situation, if you could somehow mentally train yourself, or evolve over a few generations, to do without sound? Might this be a workable, natural mode of existence? Could you internalise the fear and remain silent to avoid the predators in the way that you might naturally change your habits in some locales to avoid bears or snakes?'),
(19, 'Midsommar is an outrageous black-comic carnival of agony, starring charismatic Florence Pugh in a comely robe and floral headdress. It features funny-tasting pies and chorally assisted ritual sex, with pagan celebrants gazing into the middle distance and warbling as solemnly as the young dudes in the Coca-Cola TV ad about teaching the world to sing. It‚Äôs all set in an eerily beautiful sunlit plain, bounded by forests and lakes. This is supposed to be somewhere in northern Sweden, but was filmed in Hungary, and Aster, cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski and production designer Henrik Svensson have collaborated on what are surely digitally assisted images: the sky and fields becoming a bouquet of vivid and beautiful blues and greens. The music from British composer Bobby Krlic (AKA the Haxan Cloak) is sensually creepy.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIt‚Äôs a thoroughly enjoyable film, a crescendo of paranoid trippiness building to an uproarious grossout in its final moments ‚Äì of which the poster image, incidentally, gives you no clue. Once we are in that weirdly unreal Swedish clearing, the narrative turbulence clears and things appear initially as calm as a millpond. Yet there is a point to that becalmedness. It helps create the ambient disquiet.'),
(20, 'The film is drenched with eroticism: it permeates the surfaces and textures, the rituals of teacher and pupil ‚Äì the preposterous pretext for the Count‚Äôs visits is that he is teaching her to paint ‚Äì and of course in the secret theatre of sex that plays out in the world of mistress and maidservant. In the licensed intimacy of Hideko‚Äôs bedroom, Sook-hee is allowed to undress Hideko, who playfully pretends to be the servant by undressing her in turn. In the manner of classic Victorian erotica, the handmaiden demonstrates to her awestruck mistress in bed exactly what she can expect on her wedding night.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Handmaiden is about pornography, albeit pornography of the high-minded connoisseur kind from the Gutenberg age: rare books. Hideko has to read aloud from sub-Sadean material and then ‚Äì in a fantastically twisted scene ‚Äì pose on a kind of porn trapeze with a male mannequin. And porn‚Äôs undertow of shame has a political dimension. It is a cousin to the mortification of submitting to colonial rule. But sex is the sanctuary from pornography in The Handmaiden, the sex that Hideko and Sook-hee enjoy is the refuge from porn and its furniture of abuse and control.');
